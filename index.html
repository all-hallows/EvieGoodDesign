<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Evie</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am currently working towards a degree in History, with a minor in Sociology and certificate in Public and Professional Writing. When I first came to Pitt, I was declared as an English Writing Fiction major, but quickly realized that was not the place for me. I decided to pick up the PPW certificate as a way to keep writing after experiencing fiction burnout and am specifically interested in grant writing and graphic design—the latter mostly just for fun. While taking a general education Sociology class, I made a mentor in my professor who helped me carve out a new path in History and Sociology. I feel that these two fields embody my love for asking questions and stoke my passion for fighting for social justice, which is my thematic focus.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>Though I have little experience with graphic design, I am a creative with too many hobbies and a never ending stream of projects. I prefer to learn new skills to customize things to my liking instead of outsourcing a project to someone else, for everything from fixing my car to weaving a rug. My primary media are second hand textiles and fibers which I use to sew, knit, and crochet my own clothes and decor. Aesthetic is very important to me and I'm driven by the fact I can design almost anything to fit my style. I'm looking forward to exploring Adobe platforms more in this class because I think they will be useful tools to have in my toolbelt going forward—both personally and professionally. I'd really like to design some cool posters for my new apartment, so maybe I'll get a chance to do that here. </h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3> Good design to me is something that instantly catches my eye and makes me think, "wow, that looks good!" I find it hard to describe why I think something looks good or bad—something I'm excited to learn more about in this class—but I usually feel objective in whether my brain likes looking at whatever design is in front of me. That being said, I do think my design aesthetic is quite particular and I gravitate towards certain colors and aesthetics more than others. I'm inspired by Americana, 60s and 70s fashion and media, maximalism, and eclecticsm. Some qualities that I think are very important to good design include balance, contrast, and use of color. </h3>

Under the house there are various pieces of furniture in the same bright colors, including a shelf, a chest, a bassinette, and two chairs. Above the title and below the exterior photo, there is a photo of the house interior, featuring a tiled fire place and bright blue dining nook with a chair and bench. >

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>My concrete plans for the future are entirely unknown to me, but I am certain of a few things: I know that the corporate world is not for me; I know that I need a creative outlet in my life to feel like myself; I know that I want whatever work I do to allign with my values of people over profit, anti-facsism, and collective liberation. With my degrees and interests, I'm beginning to weigh the options of continuing my education either to stay in academia or pursue law. I think the hardest part of my decision making thus far has been trying to figure out how I can compile all of my interests into a field of work that I will enjoy and will keep me financially afloat—especially with Pitt draining any dreams of a debt-free existence right before my eyes. I've even thought about picking up a trade. More than anything, I just want to be able to live a loving existence with my partner, enjoy beautiful art, feel intellectually stimulated, and know that the work I do contributes to a better society. I think this class is going to teach me a lot of skills that will feed my creative and intellectual needs, and perhaps will even broaden my horizons in the professional world.</h3>
